<p>I recognize that historical injustice, social inequalities and cultural representations have made science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) a hostile field for many marginalized groups, where women, certain ethnic groups, people with disabilities and those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds are underrepresented. I am committed to support and uplift members of these groups, both because I believe that including many diverse voices is critical to the advancement of science and technology, especially in domains with large societal impact like artificial intelligence and biomedical science, and because I believe that it is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>In practice, my journey to becoming <a href="https://guidetoallyship.com/">a better ally</a> includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fighting unconscious biases when recruiting and evaluating collaborators</li>
        <li>fostering a workplace culture where everyone is heard and respected</li>
        <li>engaging in education activities for diverse audiences</li>
        <li>promoting open science, including open access publications and open source code, to make scientific research available to everyone</li>
        <li>standing against algorithmic discrimination, by considering the ethical implication of my research before starting projects and constantly mitigating possible <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/UCB_Playbook_R10_V2_spreads2.pdf">algorithmic biases</a></li>
    </ul>
