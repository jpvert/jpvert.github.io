I am a research scientist and professor, working on machine learning (a.k.a. artificial intelligence) and computational biology. My long-term goal is to understand how machines can learn from data, and to use them to power scientific breakthroughs in biology and medicine.

**Currently**

My main occupation is to serve as the chief R&D officer at [Owkin](https://owkin.com), a French-American AI biotech company that uses artificial intelligence to find the right treatment for every patient. Our focus is to use AI to discover and develop better treatments for unmet medical needs, starting with the fight against cancer. And by the way, [we're hiring](https://owkin.com/hiring#current-opportunities)!

In my free time, I also benevolently serve as
- affiliate research professor at PSL University's [Centre for computational biology at Mines Paris](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr)
- lecturer in various universities, including ENS Paris-Saclay's [MVA master course](https://www.master-mva.com), and AIMS' [African Master's in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org)
- fellow at [ELLIS Health](https://ellis.eu/programs/ellis-health)
- action editor at [JMLR](https://www.jmlr.org/editorial-board.html), section editor at [BMC Bioinformatics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board)
- scientific advisory board member at [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/themenmenue/our-model/helmholtz-ai-boards/index.html) and [MIAI](https://miai.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/institut-miai/gouvernance/comite-scientifique-international)
- member of the strategic orientation council at [Université Côte d'Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.eu) and of the Assembly at [Institut Pasteur](https://www.pasteur.fr/en/institut-pasteur/our-governance/assembly)
- reviewer and (senior) program committee member of conferences in machine learning and in computational biology (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ISMB etc...)

**Previously**

Before joining Owkin in 2022, I was a research scientist at Google Brain (2018-2022), where I led a research team working on core machine learning and computational biology, and helped start the Paris lab. Before Google, I have been a research professor at ENS Paris' mathematics Department (2016-2018); a Fullbright and Miller visiting professor at UC Berkeley's Department of Statistics (2015-2016); a research team leader at the Curie Institute's research center (2008-2018); a research professor and founding director of Mines ParisTech's Centre for Computational Biology (2002-2018); and a research associate at Kyoto University's Bioinformatics Center (2001-2002). I graduated in applied mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique (1995) and received my PhD in mathematics from Paris University (2001).
